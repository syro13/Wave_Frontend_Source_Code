    Wave is a wellbeing application designed specifically to support college students who want help in managing various aspects of their overwhelming and busy lives. Not only recognising this, but experiencing it, is what helped us to come up with this idea. Wave aims to help in a wide range of tasks from financial budgeting advice to task management down to general wellbeing, all in the aim of creating a better college experience and minimising the possibility of burning out.
